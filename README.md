# 🐍 Classic Snake Game — Python Turtle Edition

This is a fully functional version of the **classic Snake Game**, built entirely in **Python** using the built-in `turtle` graphics module. Designed using **object-oriented programming**, the game features real-time movement, collision detection, score tracking, and persistent high score saving.

---

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

- Control the snake using **arrow keys** (`↑ ↓ ← →`)
- Eat the red food to grow longer and earn points
- Avoid hitting the walls or the snake's own body
- Try to **beat your highest score**, which is saved automatically!

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x**
- Built-in **turtle module** for graphics and animation
- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)** for modular code design
- Basic **file handling** for high score persistence (`Highest_score.txt`)
- **`time` module** for frame delay and smooth animation
